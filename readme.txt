**How this could help you?**

*   Every-time you save a new post or pages, WordPress creates a revision of that post or page. If you edit a post 6 times you might have 5 copy of that post as revisions. Imagine if your post or pages are long and big. It is a huge number of bytes that's on your MySQL overhead. WP Clean Up Optimizer allows you to optimize and shrink your posts table by removing not necessary post revisions from the database.
*   Similar to the scenario described above, there might be thousands of spam and un-approved comments in your comments table, WP Clean Up Optimizer can clean and remove those in a single click
*   WP Clean Up Optimizer reports which database tables have overhead and wasted spaces also it allows you to shrink and get rid of those wasted spaces
*   Automatically cleans database every week and respects the "Keeps selected number of weeks data" option.
